## Toast Component

The new Toast component provides a flexible and accessible way to show temporary notifications in your application. It comes with built-in support for different placements, variants, and animations. Inspired by [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/), our Toast component brings a beautiful, minimal, and customizable notification system to HeroUI.

### Setup

First, add the `ToastProvider` to your application:

```tsx
// app/providers.tsx
import {HeroUIProvider, ToastProvider} from '@heroui/react'
// for individual components use the following import
// import {ToastProvider} from '@heroui/toast'


export default function Providers({children}) {
  return (
    <HeroUIProvider>
      <ToastProvider />
        {children}
    </HeroUIProvider>
  )
}
```

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import {Button, addToast} from "@heroui/react";

function Example() {
  return (
    <Button 
      onPress={() => {
        addToast({
          title: "Success",
          description: "Your changes have been saved successfully.",
        });
      }}
    >
      Show Toast
    </Button>
  );
}
```

<CodeDemo
  title="Simple Usage"
  files={simpleToast}
/>


### Features

- Multiple placement options (top, bottom, left, right, center)
- Different variants (solid, bordered, flat)
- Custom timeout duration
- Progress indicator
- Promise support for loading states
- Customizable icons and styling
- Accessibility built-in

<CodeDemo title="Toast Examples" files={toastUsage} />

For more examples and detailed documentation about the Toast component, visit our [Toast documentation](/docs/components/toast).

## NumberInput Component

A new specialized input component for numerical values with built-in validation, formatting, and keyboard controls.

<CodeDemo title="Number Input Usage" files={numberInputContent} />

For more examples and detailed documentation about the NumberInput component, visit our [NumberInput documentation](/docs/components/number-input).

## New Spinner Variants

The Spinner component now includes new design variants, offering more options for loading states in your applications.

<CodeDemo title="New Spinner Variants" files={spinnerVariantsContent} />

For more examples and detailed documentation about the Spinner component, visit our [Spinner documentation](/docs/components/spinner).

## Theme Generator

The new Theme Generator is a powerful web-based tool that allows you to create and customize your themes visually. Simply visit our [Theme Generator](/themes) to:

- Create custom color schemes
- Preview components with your theme in real-time
- Generate the theme code automatically
- Export your theme configuration
- Test different color combinations
- Ensure proper contrast and accessibility

This tool makes it easier than ever to maintain consistent design across your application without having to write theme configuration manually.

For more information about theming and customization, visit our [Theme documentation](/docs/customization/customize-theme).

## Table Virtualization

The Table component now supports virtualization, significantly improving performance when working with large datasets.

```tsx
import {Table} from "@heroui/react";

function Example() {
  return (
    <Table
      isVirtualized
      itemHeight={50} // Required for virtualization
    >
      {/* Table content */}
    </Table>
  );
}
```

<CodeDemo title="Table Virtualization" files={tableVirtualizationContent} />

For more examples and detailed documentation about the Table component, visit our [Table documentation](/docs/components/table).

## New Global Props

We've added new global configuration options to the `HeroUIProvider` that allow you to set default behaviors across your application:

#### Label Placement

You can now set a global default for label placement across all form-based components. This affects components that have the `labelPlacement` property, including:

- Input
- Select
- Autocomplete
- DatePicker
- DateRangePicker
- TimeInput
- NumberInput
- And more...

```tsx
import {HeroUIProvider} from "@heroui/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <HeroUIProvider labelPlacement="outside">
      {/* All form components will have outside labels by default */}
    </HeroUIProvider>
  );
}
```

#### Spinner Variant

You can set a global default spinner variant that will be used by all components that show loading states, including:

- Select
- Autocomplete
- Button
- And other components that use loading indicators

```tsx
import {HeroUIProvider} from "@heroui/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <HeroUIProvider spinnerVariant="simple">
      {/* All components will use the dots spinner variant by default */}
    </HeroUIProvider>
  );
}
```

You can combine multiple global props to maintain consistent behavior throughout your application:

```tsx
import {HeroUIProvider} from "@heroui/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <HeroUIProvider 
      labelPlacement="outside"
      spinnerVariant="simple"
    >
      {/* Your app content */}
    </HeroUIProvider>
  );
}
```

For more information about global configuration options, visit our [Provider documentation](/docs/api-references/heroui-provider).

## Keyboard Support

Enhanced keyboard support with the addition of `fn`, `win`, and `alt` keys for better accessibility and user interaction.

## Type Improvements

Better TypeScript support with exported `PressEvent` type for `onPress` event handling:

```tsx
import type {PressEvent} from "@heroui/react";

function handlePress(e: PressEvent) {
  // Your press event handler
}
```
